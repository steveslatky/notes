## Shift Cipher - Also known as Ceazer Shift

### Possible attacks

Kerchoff's Principle

* Cipher text only
    Only have encrypted message
    1. Brute force
    2. Look for most frequently occuring symbol 

* Known PLaintext
    1. m + k = c(mod 26)

* Chosen Plaintext
    1. 1 + k = c(mmod26)

* Chosen Ciphertext
    1. m + k = 1(mod26)


Most commomly used letter is E

## Frequency Analysis

Not only do you have to look at the frequencey of the letters but the context of them
So if there are duplicates in a row. Or where they show up in a word.
