# More States. 

There has to be a solution in the search tree. 

## Tree search

b = branching factor
d = maximum depth]
m = maxium steps to completion


### Breadth-first seach

Is complete 
**time**:  O(b^(d+1))
**space**: b^(d+1) 
**Optimal**: Yes

### Uniform-cost search

A slight variant of breadth-first. 

Expland the least-cost unexpanded node.

**complete** - yes
**Time** O(b^C/sigma)) 
**Space** - # of nodes with g<= cost of optimal solution. Still expodential
**Optimal** - yes 

### Depth-first Search

Expand deepest unexpanded node

**Complete**: Maybe. If there is a bounded depth. And infinte loops makes it no. 
**Time**: O(B^m) 
**Space**: Low mem. Only need to keep childern of current branch. O(bm); 
**Optimal**: No. 

### Iterative deepining search
Has the benifits of Breadth-frist but the memory size of Deepth-first. 

**complete** yes. 
**Time** O(b^(d+1))
**Space** (bm)
**Optimal**: Yes if every step is uniform.
