# Rational Agents 

**Agent** - entity can perceive and act upon the environment, has a particular goal. 


## Two questions   
    * what is the function 
    * Can it be implemented as a computer program

## Rationally 

Assume it has a performances measure.

If agent chooses actions to maximize reward, it is seen as being rational. 

Rationally does not imply clairvoyance.
Rational does not mean successful. 

## Properties of Environments

* Observable - Agent can sense the entire state
* Deterministic - Outcome of actions is determined by state of action executed
* Sequential - Actions outcomes can be effected by prior actions
* static - state of world does not change
* Discrete - Actions can only be performed in a small fixed number of ways
* Single-Agent: Only one agent of change


# Types of agents

## State based
based on the state around agent. 

## Goal based 
Give agent a goal. Take actions to maximize the goal. 

## Utility based
Assigns an utility and uses utility based on state

## Learning 
Anytime agent does not reach a certain standard, learn and change actions
